This project involved exploring the use of GANs to generate so-called "fake" turbulence. The way GANs learn is quite interesting, and unique to that of other traditional supervised methods. In a traditional supervised learning objective we have access to the true labels (i.e a class for classification taks, or a score for regression tasks). Therefore, when we make a prediction with our model we have a direct way of assessing how accurate our prediction is: in a regression task we could just take the distance between our predictions and their associated true values. This is how we train supervised models. We punish the model when the distance between its predictions and reality are high, and reward it when that distance is low - ushering it towards the minimal distance.

Now, GANs are an unsupervised method. What this means is that the model isn't provided with labels, it only has access to features. A GAN consists of two players: a generator and a discriminator. The objective of the generator is to generate samples indistinguishable from the true distribution of images. The objective of the discriminator is to take those samples generated by the generator and compare them to real samples, and ideally tell the difference between the two. I'll lay out a situation to hopefully help make this more clear. Consider this situation: What if I want to train somebody to draw trees? Let's call this person the student. I also pull in a second person to act as a teacher. Now, I have access to a large amount of tree images, everything from coniferous trees to bonsai trees. I start by giving a few of these images at a time to the teacher. The student doesn't have direct access to the tree images, he can only extract information through the teacher. So the student draws some arbitrary images and the teacher punishes him when they don't look like the images I provided, and rewards the student when they look similar. Meanwhile, I also punish the teacher when they make an incorrect judgement on a student generated image. Throughout this process the student ends up getting better at generating images, and the teacher gets better at telling the difference between the student's images and the real ones.

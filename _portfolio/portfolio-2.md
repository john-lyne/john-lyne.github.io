This project involved exploring the use of GANs to generate so-called "fake" turbulence. The way GANs learn is quite interesting, and unique to that of other traditional supervised methods. In a traditional supervised learning objective we have access to the true labels (i.e a class for classification taks, or a score for regression tasks). Therefore, when we make a prediction with our model we have a direct way of assessing how accurate our prediction is: in a regression task we could just take the distance between our predictions and their associated true values. This is how we train supervised models. We punish the model when the distance between its predictions and reality are high, and reward it when that distance is low - ushering it towards the minimal distance.

Now, GANs are an unsupervised method. What this means is that the model isn't provided with labels, it only has access to features. A GAN consists of two players: a generator and a discriminator. The objective of the generator is to generate samples indistinguishable from the true distribution of images. The objective of the discriminator is to take those samples generated by the generator and compare them to real samples, and ideally tell the difference between the two. I'll lay out a situation to hopefully help make this more clear. 

Consider this situation: What if I want to train somebody to draw trees? Let's call this person the student. I also pull in a second person to act as a teacher. Now, I have access to a large amount of tree images, everything from coniferous trees to bonsai trees. I start by giving a few of these images at a time to the teacher. The student doesn't have direct access to the tree images, he can only extract information through the teacher. So the student draws some arbitrary images and the teacher punishes him when they don't look like the images I provided, and rewards the student when they look similar. 
Meanwhile, I also punish the teacher when they make an incorrect judgement on a student generated image. When we look at the distribution of trees, there are distinct classes of trees - trees with needles, leafy trees, and more. Along the way we can imagine the student generating a hybrid oak/pine tree, and our teacher should pick up on this and usher the student to generate images of these disctinct classes in seperate images. Throughout this process the student ends up getting better at generating images, and the teacher gets better at telling the difference between the student's images and the real ones.
Eventually we reach a point where either the student can't draw better images, or the teacher can't get better at telling the difference between the student drawings and the real ones. If this push and pull learning experience between the two actors (student and teacher) goes smoothly, it yields a student who is exceptional at drawing realistic trees. The interesting part about this, is that the trees drawn by the student aren't necessarily real. It's just a tree that is entirely plausible given the distribution of tree images we provided. We have a student with the ability to **synthesize** tree images.

Back to more a more technical scope, we can observe this in a typical loss function used in GANs. The goal of the network is to minimize these loss functions. The top one pertains to the teacher - the teacher obtains samples and provides a score. The loss function for the teacher attempts to maximize the scores on real samples, and minimize the scores on generated (i.e student) samples. Meanwhile the student tries to maximize the teacher's scores on their samples.

I am a graduate student pursuing a MASc. in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I obtained my undergraduate degree in the Mechanical Engineering Co-operative Program from the University of Alberta, graduating with distinction. During my undergraduate degree I accumulated internship experience in the energy, industrial construction, and commercial aviation industries.

My research interests lie at the intersection between machine learning and fluid dynamics. In other words, leveraging the dense spatio-temporal datasets produced by direct numerical simulations of fluid flow, and employing data driven learning algorithms to develop a better understanding of the turbulent phenomena present in these simulations.

Below is an image I generated by segmenting distinct regions in a fluid velocity field, and coloring the corresponding clusters. I tweaked the true image a bit by stretching/compressing certain dimensions, and what came out is a beautiful digital abstraction of fluid behaviour.

Aircraft performance engineer at Bombardier.

I also write on **Substack**. Topics of relevance include philosophy, biology, physics, complex systems, psychology, history, and literature. Check it out [here](https://johnlyne.substack.com/).

Reading fuels my writing. Book notes of mine are recorded [here](https://john-lyne.github.io/booknotes/).

Education
======
Undergraduate degree in the Mechanical Engineering Co-operative Program from the University of Alberta. During which, internship experience was gained in the energy, industrial construction, and commercial aviation industries.

MASc. in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Research interests laid at the intersection between machine learning and fluid dynamics. The goal of the research was to leverage the dense spatio-temporal datasets produced by direct numerical simulations of fluid flow, and employ data driven learning algorithms to develop a better understanding of the turbulent phenomena present in these simulations.

### September 2020 - December 2022

#### **MASc. in Systems Design Engineering - Machine Learning and Intelligence Specialization, [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/), Waterloo, Ontario, Canada** 
##### **Graduate Course Work: Fluid Mechanics, Hydrodynamic Stability and Turbulence, Mathematics of Computation, Pattern Recognition**

##### **Cumulative GPA: 4.0/4.0**

### September 2015 - April 2020

#### **Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/index.html), Edmonton, Alberta, Canada**

##### **Co-operative Program with Distinction**

##### Favourite Courses: Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics, Energy Conversion

##### **Cumulative GPA: 3.6/4.0**

Hobbies & Interests

I enjoy reading, writing, and my daily walk through the park. I've maintained a strength training practice over the last decade and have cultivated a meditation practice for the past few years.

Fluid Dynamics Art

The image below was generated with the help of physics and computer science! The shapes here are the physical shapes that a fluid velocity field takes when forced along a channel. The colors represent a topology of the fluid's speed. This topology was generated with the help of machine learning. See more [here](https://john-lyne.github.io/art/).

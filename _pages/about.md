Aircraft performance engineer at Bombardier.

I also write on **Substack**. Topics include philosophy, biology, physics, complex systems, psychology, history, and literature. Check it out [here](https://johnlyne.substack.com/). The publication is called *In Finity*, [here's a bit about how I came up with this name](https://johnlyne.substack.com/p/in-finity).

Reading fuels my writing. I record my book notes [here](https://john-lyne.github.io/booknotes/).

I enjoy reading, writing, and my daily walk through the park. I've maintained a strength training practice for the last decade and have cultivated a meditation practice over the past few years.

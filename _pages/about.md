Performance engineer for Bombardier's Global aircraft series. Aircraft performance is a function of aircraft weight and geometry, engine thrust, atmospheric properties, and particular condition (takeoff, landing, cruising) of the flight. Performance engineers define the operational capabliltes and ensure the safe operation of aircraft, in particular in the case of engine failure. Optimizing performance reduces the costs of operating the aircraft, thus improved aircraft performance correlates positively with the price of aircraft.

Education
======
I obtained my undergraduate degree in the Mechanical Engineering Co-operative Program from the University of Alberta. During my undergraduate degree I accumulated internship experience in the energy, industrial construction, and commercial aviation industries. As a graduate student I pursued a MASc. in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

My research interests laid at the intersection between machine learning and fluid dynamics. In other words, the goal was to leverage the dense spatio-temporal datasets produced by direct numerical simulations of fluid flow, and employ data driven learning algorithms to develop a better understanding of the turbulent phenomena present in these simulations.

Hobbies & Interests

In my spare time I enjoy reading, writing, and playing chess. To remain active I strength train ~3 time per week and cardiovascular train ~3 times per week. I like to bake as well, with pumpkin spice cupcakes and apple pies having recently been added to my culinary resume. I am also learning Tagalog, though hindi ako marunong mag-tagalog mabuti.


I also enjoy watching anime, among my favourite shows is Demon Slayer. The art in this show is exceptional; the powers exhibited by the main character are heavily influenced by fluids.

Fluid Dynamics Art

The image below was generated with the help of physics and computer science! The shapes here are the physical shapes that a fluid velocity field takes when forced along a channel. The colors represent a topology of the fluid's speed. This topology was generated with the help of machine learning. See more [here](https://john-lyne.github.io/art/).

I am a graduate student pursuing a MASc. in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I obtained my undergraduate degree in the Mechanical Engineering Co-operative Program from the University of Alberta, graduating with distinction. During my undergraduate degree I accumulated internship experience in the energy, industrial construction, and commercial aviation industries.

My research interests lie at the intersection between machine learning and fluid dynamics. In other words, my goal is to leverage the dense spatio-temporal datasets produced by direct numerical simulations of fluid flow, and employ data driven learning algorithms to develop a better understanding of the turbulent phenomena present in these simulations.

Hobbies & Interests
---
In my spare time I enjoy playing chess and playing the frustrating (yet fulfilling) game of golf. To remain active I strength train 3-5 times per week. I like to bake as well, with pumpkin spice cupcakes and apple pies having recently been added to my culinary resume. 

I also enjoy watching anime, among my favourite shows is Demon Slayer. The art in this show is exceptional, it helps that the powers exhibited by the main character are heavily influenced by fluids (as seen below).

Fluid Dynamics Art

Below is an image generated by segmenting distinct regions of a streamwise channel flow velocity field near the channel's bottom surface, and coloring the corresponding clusters. I tweaked the true image a bit by stretching/compressing certain dimensions, what came out is a beautiful digital abstraction of fluid behaviour.

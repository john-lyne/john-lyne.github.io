A collection of notes from fictional books. Although, isn't everything fictional to some extent? Can fact and fiction ever be disentangled?

# *The Ministry for the Future*, Kim Robinson
The Ministry for the Future is a novel set in the near future which describes the disastrous consequences of a warming planet and the steps humanity takes to mitigate them. It is ultimately an optimistic story about technological and political innovation.

- “A voice cannot carry the tongue and the lips that gave it wings. Alone it must enter the ether. And alone and without his nest shall the eagle fly across the sun.”
- “How often have you sailed in my dreams. And now you come into my awakening, which is my deeper dream.”
- “And you, vast sea, sleeping mother…I shall come to you, a boundless drop to a boundless ocean.”
- “If this indeed by the honour in which I lift up my lantern, it is not my flame that shall burn therein. Empty and dark shall I raise my lantern, and the guardian of the night shall fill it with oil and he shall light it also.”
- “Ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.”
- To add more... Very good little book.

- “[History] cannot be interpreted without the aid of imagination and intuition. The sheer quantity of evidence is so overwhelming that selection is inevitable. Where there is selection there is art. Those who read history tend to look for what proves them right and confirms their personal opinions. They defend loyalties. They read with a purpose to affirm or to attack. They resist inconvenient truth since everyone wants to be on the side of the angels. Just as we start wars to end all wars.” — B. H. Liddell Hart
- “Less ego, more wealth. Saving money is the gap between your ego and your income, and wealth is what you don’t see.”
- “If you want to do better as an investor, the single most powerful things you can do is increase your time horizon. Time is the most powerful force in investing. It makes little things grow big and big mistakes fade away.”
- “Be nicer and less flashy. No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are. […] What you probably want is respect and admiration. And you’re more likely to gain those things through kindness and humility.”

# *The Great Leveler*, Walter Scheidel
Historical analysis of wealth inequality in societies, and their seemingly inevitable rebalancing that tend to point back to one of four "levelers": mass mobilization warfare, transformative revolution, state failure, and lethal pandemics. Interestingly, a trend that has occured consitenly in historical records is the fact that the more peaceful a society, the higher wealth inequality within its population.

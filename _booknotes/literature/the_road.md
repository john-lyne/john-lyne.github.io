- “The small wad of burning paper drew down to a wisp of flame and then died out leaving a faint pattern for just a moment in the incandescence like the shape of a flower, a molten rose. Then all was dark again.”
- “All things of grace and beauty such that one holds them to one’s heart have a common provenance in pain. Their birth in grief and ashes.”
- “They say that women dream of danger to those in their care and men of danger to themselves. But I don’t dream at all.”
- “This is my child, he said. I wash a dead man’s brains out of his hair. This is my job.”
	- Steering away from bad ideas.

- “So be it. Evoke the forms. Where you’ve nothing else construct ceremonies out of the air and breathe upon them.”
- “The water was so clear. He held it to the light. A single bit of sediment coiling in the jar on some slow hydraulic axis.”
- “He walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world.”
- “Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.”
- “The faintly lit hatchway lay in the dark of the yard like a grave yawning at judgment day in some old apocalyptic painting.”
- “The men poured gasoline on them and burned them alive, having no remedy for evil but only for the image of it as they conceived it to be.”
- “When your dreams are of some world that never was or of some world that never will be and you are happy again then you will have given up. Do you understand? And you cant give up. I wont let you.”
- “The incinerate corpses shrunk to the size of a child and propped on the bare springs of the seats. Ten thousand dreams ensepulchred within their crozzled hearts.”
- “In the few glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.”

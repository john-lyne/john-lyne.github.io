A collection of notes from books read on eastern philosophy including buddhism, buddhist psychology, buddhist philosophy, and confucian philosophy.

# *Why Buddhism is True*, Robert Wright, 2017
A book exploring the principles of secular Buddhism while connecting them to the foundation of evolution. Evolution shaped how we experience the world, and mindfulness addresses some of the misperceptions brought about by a brain designed to see what will help its genes thrive, rather than to see what is "true".

# *Understanding Our Mind*, Thich Nhat Hanh
The workings of the mind from a buddhist perspective, courtesy of seasoned Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh. Very metaphorical. From those of a western educational background, this book gently exposes the reader to the more holistic ways of Eastern thought.

# *Zen and the Art of Saving the Planet*, Thich Nhat Hanh
More buddhist philosophy, and how to approach the tumultuous world of today with compassion, acceptance, and curiosity.

# *The Analects of Confucius*
Confucian philosphy. Timeless insights such as "Rotten wood cannot be carved" and "[to] avoid burglary, build up qualities that cannot be stolen, rather than ostentatious material goods that can be."

# *Awakening the Buddha Within*, Lama Surya Das
Lessons on the Buddhist canon by a man from New York who, upon finding himself in Nepal, stumbled upon his spiritual home. Very digestible interpretation of Buddhist philosophy for readers of a Western background.

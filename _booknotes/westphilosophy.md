# *The True Believer*, Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements, Eric Hoffer (1951)
Eric Hoffer was a self-educated layman, and his books awarded him multiple honorary doctorates as well as a presidential medal of freedom.
One of the best books I've ever read. Short and sweet, I gobbled this one up in a few days. I took notes for practically every page.

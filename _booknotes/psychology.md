# *Happiness Hypothesis* by Jonathan Haidt
A book about happiness that uses a clever metaphor to describe the conflict between primitive motives and conscious thought.
### Neurological System Basics
* The mind can be viewed as an elephant and a rider. The rider (our conscious thought) can direct the elephant (our more primitive neurological systems) to turn, stop, or go. But, when the elephant has a desire of its own, the rider is no match to control it
* Limbic system (limbus means border/margin) wraps around rest of the brain, forming a border
    * Hypothalamus: coordinates basic drives and motivations
    * Hippocampus: specialized for memory
    * Amygdala: specialized for emotional learning and responding
* The neocortex (meaning new covering in Latin) developed later as the grey matter characteristic of the brain, providing functions such as impulse control, planning ahead, thinking, and decision making
    * Individuals with a compromised prefrontal cortex normally see increases in sexual aggression, inability to control impulses
* The bottom third of the prefrontal cortex is the orbitofrontal cortex, just above the eyes, and is related to emotional responses (i.e feelings of pleasure and pain)
* The elephant is like the limbic system (reptilian brain), and the rider is like the neocortex. The rider evolved to serve to the elephant
* Stimuli are first passed through the amygdala (part of the limbic system) prior to reaching the neocortex. Amygdala has direct connection to flight or fight response, and detects patterns associated with previous fear episodes. Therefore neural impulses tend to be negative, because we react before we can even process them, and rightfully so, since in some situations we need as immediate a reaction as possible (i.e jump scares in horror movies)
•	Cognitive triad of depression: I’m no good, my world is bleak, and my future is hopeless
### Reciprocity
* Other ultra social species (ants, bees) evolved such that all offspring are siblings, due to a single shared queen, with most offspring being sterile. Thus, the group had no problem sacrificing themselves for each other as it optimizes the continuation of genes
* Humans in large societies, on the other hand, need a different strategy, as they are not all siblings and live outside the hive. Hence, reciprocity emerges - scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours
* Gossip evolved to keep track of bad actors in society, gain trust of others, and gauge allegiances
* A common sales tactic is to use reciprocity against you, offer something for free and people will feel an urge to return the favour
### Hypocrisy
* Moral hypocrisy: many studies have shown people that think they are particularly moral believe they are more likely to “do the right thing”. But, when the coin flip comes up against them (and to the benefit of someone else), they find a way to ignore what is right and follow self interest 
* *Motivated reasoning*: a one-sided search for supporting evidence only 
* When asked relative contributions to housework, couples combined perceived contributions come out to an average of 120%. Same with MBA students, who when asked for their contributions to a group project the total came to be 139%
### Pursuit of Happiness
* *Progress principle*: pleasure comes more from making progress towards goals than from achieving them
* *Adaptation principle*: people’s judgements about their present state are based on whether it is better or worse than the state to which they have become accustomed 
    * Nerve property: nerve cells respond vigorously to new stimuli, but eventually “habituate, firing less to stimuli that they have become accustomed to”. Change contains vital information, not steady states
* Genetics have a strong level on one’s average level of happiness
* A good marriage is one of the life factors most strongly associated with happiness. An inverse correlation is that happiness causes marriage (happier people are more appealing as partners and easier to live with)
* Happiness has a weak relationship to environment: as long as someone has basic needs satisfied, attractive people aren’t as happy as less attractive, people in warm places aren’t as happy as cold places, younger people aren’t as happy as older, etc.
* *Happiness Formula*: (H)appiness = S(baseline genetic) + (C)onditions + (V)oluntary activities
• Conditions have little effect for the most part (i.e race, sex, disability, wealth, marital status, where you live). The conditions that do matter are:
    * Noise
    * Commute (traffic)
    * Lack of control (providing workers, students, patients with a sense of control increases happiness)
    * Shame (breast augmentation surgeries on average report increases in quality of life and decreases in depression and anxiety. It helps to alleviate the shame associated with a daily burden of feeling less than others, though I imagine one must be careful such that cosmetic surgeries do not become a primary source of personal well-being
    * Relationships
* Voluntary activities include pleasures (food, sex) and gratifications (challenging tasks that match one’s abilities)
* The key to finding your own gratifications is to know your strengths
* Why do people spend money on luxuries, to which they adapt completely, rather than on things that would make them lastingly happier?
    * Conspicuous consumption: things that are visible to others that advertise elevated status (bigger house, nicer watch, better purse)
    * Inconspicuous consumption: things/activities consumed privately, not bought for the purpose of achieving status (long vacations, short commutes)
    * Inconspicuous consumption leads to more happiness. But the elephant cares about prestige (what others think of me), not happiness
* *Happiness comes from within, and happiness comes from without*
### Love and Attachment
* Attachment theory: two basic goals guide a child’s behaviour: safety and exploration. A child who stays safe survives, a child who explores and plays develops the skills and intelligence needed for adult life
* Mammal babies play, the larger the frontal cortex the more the need to play
* Secure, avoidant, resistant behavioural patterns are developed genetically and from parental/environmental influence
    * Happier babies (genetic) could make mothers more loving
    * More loving mothers (behavioural) could make happier babies
* These patterns follow us throughout romantic relationships as well, more secure adults enjoy happier, longer relationships with lower rates of divorce
* Most other mammalian babies’ brains are mostly developed at birth. Hence, there is less of a long burden for the mother, and the father can go and mate with other females. Human brains continue to develop years after birth. The mother incurs a longer burden, therefore male support is required for longer, helping to explain why pair bonding was required to best pass on genes
* Origin of “my other half”: Aristophanes said that people started off with four legs, arms, and 2 faces. But, one day the gods cut them in half. Ever since, people have been looking for their other half. As this was a Greek story, some people originally had 2 males faces, 2 female, male/female, showing the diversity in sexual orientation of that time
### Adversity
* Coping with trauma: 
    * If you have more pessimistic inclinations, try meditation/cognitive behavioural therapy/medication to help guide the elephant in the right direction
    * Have a few social attachments you can go to talk to
    * At some point afterwards, write about what happened. Make sense of it in your mind, it will help you move on. Why did this happen? What good might I derive from it?
* For adversity to be maximally beneficial, it should happen at the right time (young adulthood), to the right people (secure attachment, social resources, etc.) and to the right degree (not so severe that it causes PTSD)
### Virtues
* Trying to make children behave ethically by teaching them to reason (i.e giving scenarios and telling them what the right thing to do is) is like trying to make a dog happy by wagging its tail for him. The child learns how (not what) to think. This teaches the rider, but the elephant learns nothing
    * You can be morally against factory farming, but unless you are faced with the horrors (see it in action) you will likely still eat meat
### Meaning of Life
* People gain a sense of meaning when their lives cohere across the three levels of their existence (physical, psychological, and sociocultural)
* Happiness comes from between, from coherence between internal experiences (mind and body) and external experiences (work, relationships, community)
* There was initial puzzlement on why humans have altruistic tendencies, an initial explanation was that we are guided by group selection as well as individual selection
    * Bees and ants have no issue with altruism, sacrificing themselves for the pack, as they all share genes. The queen bee is the ovary, the bees are the body
    * But bees share genes, so why are humans altruistic? Early simulations showed that group selection, when one chooses the good of the group over themselves, was bound to be taken advantage of by selfish players (free rider problem)
    * These simulations lacked a cultural component though, and it seems like religions developed with culture to reduce the influence of free riders so that group selection could flourish (e.g marriage prevented *gigachads* from taking all the women)
* Liberals and conservatives use the myth of pure evil to demonize the other side and unite their own
    * Liberals are experts in thinking about issues of victimization, equality, autonomy, and the rights of individuals
    * Conservatives are experts in thinking about loyalty to the group, respect for authority and tradition, and sacredness
    * *Both are necessary*, individual and group motives are needed. A society without liberals would be harsh and oppressive to many individuals. A society without conservatives would lose beneficial social structures and constraints. The Ying and Yang are necessary
* A good place to find wisdom is in the minds of your opponents. If you can take off the blinders of the myth of pure evil, you might see some good ideas for the first time

# *Elephant in the Brain* by Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson
A book about psychological truths that we tend to pretend don’t exist but are more or less obvious, much like the saying “the elephant in the room”. Hence the title, the elephant in the brain.
### Body Language and Laughter
* Body language is inherently more honest than verbal language. Words are somewhat arbitrary, but physical actions carry meaning since they are enacted
* Studies have shown that women prefer the scent of males who have complimentary immune systems and more symmetric features. Same with men towards women, although women have slightly better olfactory abilities. Interestingly, homosexual men tend to prefer the scent of homosexual men as opposed to straight men when blind tested with scents from both groups
* We change the tone of our voice in the response to the status of our conversation partners. An analysis of 25 Larry King interviews showed that when a guest was of higher status, Larry would match their tone, and when of lower status, the guest would match Larry’s tone
* One of the best predictors of dominance is the dominance ratio: eye contact while speaking over eye contact while listening. Making less eye contact while speaking makes one less dominant. In a study, undergraduates talking to someone they thought was a high school senior had a ratio of 0.92, but when talking to college honour accepted into med school it was 0.59
* Laughter is used to reinforce that “I’m just playing” attitude when circumstances arise which might, if not for the laughter, be mistaken as too serious or dangerous. This helps explain why an element of danger is often required for getting a laugh
* Humour involves inviting people in playfully, carefully dialing the knob towards seriousness, and quickly falling back into play. That formula is normally what is required to open the “laughter safe”, unlocking the laughter locked inside
* A danger of laughter and humour is that we don’t all share the same norms to the same degree. When we laugh at norm violations, it often serves to weaken the norms that others may wish to uphold
* Two variables important to whether we find the misfortune of another funny: the degree of pain (a pin prick is funnier than death) and psychological distance (something bad happening to me isn’t funny, but to an enemy it can be)
     * How hard we laugh at such edge cases says a lot about our relationship to the person experiencing pain
### Conversation, News, and Gossip
* Conversation often contains text and subtext: text contains the literal information, subtext says “Look at me, I know about this information! Aren’t you impressed?”
* Speaking is a way in which to advertise your knowledge and strengths to others, such that they can gauge whether you’re an ally/mate worth having
* In the 4th century BCE, Demosthenes portrayed his fellow Athenians as preoccupied with the exchange of news, *“… remarking on the fierce concern with news that is found in preliterate or semiliterate peoples”*
### Consumption
* When individuals buy green products, part of their motive is to signal to others their pro-social attitude. It signals “I’m willing to forego luxury in order to help the planet.” This is known as conspicuous altruism
    * One reason the Prius has a distinct shape (being a hatchback, when most popular cars at the time were sedans) is to make it distinct and enhance the advertisement that their drivers are responsible, good-willed citizens 
* In advertising, lifestyle advertising is the type of advertising that attempts to link a brand or product with a particular set of cultural associations
    * The third person effect: when Corona runs a “find your beach” ad, you think you’re too savvy to be manipulated by that ad. You would never fall for that! But you, the high and mighty know it all, think everyone else can be manipulated, and that they will like Corona, and this pitiful ad. So next time you’re invited to a backyard party, you bring Corona since it’s a beer that is more for chilling out (like at the beach) and you believe everyone loves it
### Art
* Art is a fitness signal: it displays technical and creative skill, ingenuity, but also that you have time to waste
* Art has intrinsic qualities (how beautiful/captivating it is to the eye), but also extrinsic qualities (technique used, who it was created by, the era in which it was made). We tend to judge art more on its extrinsic properties. Imagine if we were to create a gallery full of replicas. Intrinsically it would look the same, but we care most that the works are original and authentic (an extrinsic quality)
### Charity
* Effective altruism: ensuring largest ROI on a charitable donation. Most don’t tend to research the charities they donate to, or how effectively their money will be managed by the charity
* Scope neglect/insensitivity: when told that a donation will save 100/1000/10000 lives/organisms/habitats, people will not meaningfully change their donation amounts despite the changes in outcomes
* Visibility: by helping donors advertise their generosity, charities incentivize more donations (i.e “I just donated blood band aids” from blood donation clinics, or selfie stations at Covid vaccination sites). Conversely, people prefer not to donate when their donation remains anonymous. Charities normally bracket donation amounts, (i.e $500-999 is a friend, $1000-1499 is a patron. Donors almost always donate to the lower bound. in other words, donors rarely give more than what they’ll be recognized for
* Mating motives: when primed with mating cues, subjects of a study were found to be more willing to engage in altruistic tasks. However, these were found to be conspicuous tasks (teaching underprivileged kids, volunteering, etc) but for inconspicuous tasks (i.e take shorter showers) they showed no difference to the control group 
* Charity is a signal of excess wealth (or time in the case of volunteering), and an advertisement of pro-social behaviour. While conspicuous consumption and charity are both signals of excess wealth, consumption is inherently selfish while charity helps the group. This helps to explain why leaders tend to be more charitable, to help the team
### Education
* School advocates often argue that school teaches students how to think critically, however educational psychologists have discovered that education is narrow, and students only learn material you specifically teach them
* Students learn worse when they’re graded, especially on a curve. Homework helps in math, not in English or history. Practice that is spaced out, varied, and interleaved with other learning produces more versatility, longer retention, and better mastery. It feels slower and more challenging, but works better
    * Teenagers perform better when classes start later
* The value in college education lies in giving students a chance to advertise the attractive qualities they already have (i.e that A in biology doesn’t mean that you’ve retained that biology knowledge)
* Education is a factor of improvement (traditional view) and certification (signalling model)
### Medicine
* More medicine doesn’t correlate with better health. For each extra day in the ICU, patients live 40 fewer days. One study showed that an additional $1000 spent on a patient resulted [-20,5] days of life gained
* Randomized control study, the RAND experiment: thousands were given either fully subsidized medical visits and treatments, some 75% discounts, some 5%. Health outcomes were found to be the same in each group, despite the fully subsidized group consuming 45% more medical aid than others
* Roughly 11% of medical spending goes to patients in their final year of life, yet it’s one of the least effective kinds of medicine. It rarely succeeds in improve quality of life; heroic end of life care is rarely pleasant for the patient. Sadly, few family members are willing to advocate for lesser care, fearing it will be seen as tantamount to abandoning their beloved relative
* One study tracked 3600 people over 7.5 years: non-smokers live 3 years longer than smokers, and those who exercised regularly lived 15 years longer than those who exercised a little. Diet and sleep are also likely significant factors. Medicine fails to provide any significant effect
* We want the best medicine (especially when others can see it’s the best), and we want to be cared for/want to help people in need (and maximize the credit we get for it). These are the two reasons to consume and provide medicine - health and conspicuous care - and the reason we end up overtreated
### Religion
* Religious sacrifice sends a signal you’re willing to sacrifice for the greater good of the group and that you can be trusted (sacrificing food, money, time, status and energy)
* Used as a trust mechanism. Before contracts, credit scores, and letters of reference, a good way to gauge trustworthy members in a community would be to see if they are willing to sacrifice their time to pray with the group
* Orthodox beliefs (i.e exact nature of the trinity, whether cracker turns into gods flesh during communion) serve as a badge to indicate one’s tribe. If the belief happens to be a little weird, stigmatizing to non-believers, it also serves as a sacrifice
    * Sports teams work the same way. The more you show support for the team, including stigmatizing behaviours like wearing face paint to a game, the more support you’ll gain from fellow fans
* Absurdity of religious beliefs = strength of religious community (see strength of the Mormon community, rewards for showing loyalty in the face of common sense)
* Celibacy/martyrdom are sacrifices in order to earn status within the religious community. This is called hill-climbing in biology. People will keep trying to go “up” on the social ladder, and in the religious context this eventually leads to celibacy/martyrdom. This is overindulgence to primitive urges, ironically hindering the propagation of genes. This also happens with eating fats and sugars these days, showing bravery in the military, addicts taking drugs until overdose, etc.
### Politics
* Apparatchik: a very loyal member of an organization who always obeys orders. Example: during Stalin’s rule, a tribute to Stalin was called for at a conference, and everyone was to applaud. Applauding went on for over 10 minutes, until the first person stopped, and some others stopped shortly after the first. These people were then killed/sent to labor camps.
* Individual political behaviours are more of a performance. We want to appear loyal to the groups around us, rather than attempting to do what’s right or try to influence outcomes. The audience of the performance are our peers, local community, friends and family, and potential romantic partners
* All or nothing with respect to a political organization’s views signals loyalty to that group

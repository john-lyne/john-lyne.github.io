# *Why Buddhism is True*, Robert Wright, 2017
A book exploring the principles of secular Buddhism while connecting them to the foundation of evolution. Evolution shaped how we experience the world, and mindfulness addresses some of the misperceptions brought about by a brain designed to see what will help its genes thrive, rather than to see what is "true".
